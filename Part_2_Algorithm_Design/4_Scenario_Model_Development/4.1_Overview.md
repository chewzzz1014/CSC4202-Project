The optimized delivery route algorithm focuses on efficiently determining delivery prioritization of food orders to multiple destinations and the best routes for deliveries. This becomes particularly significant when drivers receive multiple orders simultaneously from the same restaurant, convenience store or shop. The determination of the best route is based on a combination of two factors: the distance to be covered and the priority level of the food being delivered.  

The scenario can be divided into two main components: 
 1.	Determine the delivery prioritization of multiple food orders.
 2. Identify the best route to travel according to the determined delivery prioritization that considers distance and food quality factors.
