## 4.4 Constraints and Challenges

One of the most significant challenges of this optimization is to efficiently categories food items based on their respective food categories. This process is particularly important as it will affect the delivery prioritization for food orders, especially when all food orders have a similar distance from the restaurant. 

In our optimized algorithm, there are 3 main food categories: cooked food, cold/hot drink and dessert. However, it's important to note that not all food items fall strictly under these categories, and there may be cases where certain food items require special attention. For instance, a customer may specifically request their noodle soup to remain warm by the time they receive it. Such special conditions or requirements for food items are not explicitly covered by the optimized algorithm.

On the other hand, this optimized algorithm does not guarantee the perfect balance between distance and food contents factors. While delivery optimization is taken care of, the resulting delivery order may not always correspond to the shortest route for traveling between destinations. In some cases, there may be alternative routes that could potentially be shorter or faster than the one suggested by the optimization algorithm.
