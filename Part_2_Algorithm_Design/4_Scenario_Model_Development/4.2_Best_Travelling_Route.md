# 4.2 Best Travelling Route

Once the delivery prioritization of all food orders has been determined, the next step is to find the best travelling route based on this determined delivery order. When travelling from one destination to the next destination, the path with shortest distance must be chosen to minimize the time taken for completing the food orders. This means that there is a need to keep track of the distances between food order destinations. By maintaining the distance information for each possible path connecting the destinations, it becomes possible to compare and evaluate the different routes. The diagram below displays the representation of the scenario in the form of a weighted graph. The detailed implementation of this algorithm will be discussed in the subsequent section.
