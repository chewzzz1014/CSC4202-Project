## 4.2 Delivery Prioritization for Food Orders
For determining the delivery prioritization of food order, there are 2 possibilities. At any time, the drivers only receive 1 food order from the restaurant, so they can proceed to deliver that food order. When drivers are tasked with multiple food orders with different destinations at the same time, determining the delivery prioritization becomes more complex. In such cases, it is necessary to establish a systematic approach to prioritize and sequence the delivery of these food orders. Distance of the food order destination and food contents of the food order are considered for determining such delivery order.

Firstly, distance is the primary consideration when it comes to sequencing delivery order. The prioritization of food orders is primarily based on the distance between the starting point (typically the restaurant or shop) and the destination of each food order. The focus is on identifying the food order with the shortest traveling distance from the restaurant, regardless of the presence of a direct route between them. This approach allows for the efficient selection of the nearest food order destination, ensuring that deliveries can be made in a timely manner. 

The food contents of the food order are the secondary consideration when to comes to sequencing delivery order. The remaining shelf life of the food items is considered in determining delivery prioritization, where food items having a shorter remaining shelf life are being prioritized. For example, cold coffee is prioritized over fried chicken, and ice cream is prioritized over cold coffee. Priority values, ranging from 0 to 1, are assigned to each food category based on the remaining shelf life, indicating the level of attention required when determining the delivery prioritization.
 
However, the scenario can become more complex in certain cases. When the driver receives multiple food orders with the exact same combinations of food items, the food contents factor does not play a role in prioritization. In such cases, distance becomes the sole factor affecting the delivery prioritization. This raises the challenge of finding the right balance between distance and food contents factors. In addition, how to determine the prioritization if a food order consists of food items of different food categories, each with different priority value?
 
To address these challenges, a weight formula is used to calculate the weight value of food orders. Each food order is assigned a weight value that takes account of both the distance and priority value of the food items. The weight value is a reflection of the importance and prioritization of the food order. The food order with the lowest weight value will be delivered first, followed by the remaining food orders in ascending order of their weight value.
 
If all food orders contain the exact same combinations of food items, the priority value for all food items is assumed to be 0, and the weight value depends solely on the distance factor. On the other hand, if a food order consists of multiple food categories with different priority values, the maximum priority value among them is used to calculate the weight value of a food order. This approach ensures that the food item with the highest priority value in a food order is efficiently considered when determining the overall priority of the food order. In certain cases, the priority value of the food items can outweigh the distance factor, particularly when there are significant differences in the priority values between food orders. This will be further elaborated in the subsequent section.
