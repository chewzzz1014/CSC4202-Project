### 5.3 Best Travelling Route 

After determining the delivery prioritization, the Dijkstra algorithm will be used to find the optimal route. As the driver moves from one destination to the next destination following the determined delivery prioritization, they must choose the path with the shortest distance to the subsequent destination. In this context, the edges connecting between destinations have the weight value representing the traveling distance. Therefore, when travelling from one destination to the next, the driver should select the path with the lowest weight value, as it signifies the shortest distance. By adhering to this approach, the driver can efficiently navigate the delivery route while minimizing travel distances and ensuring timely deliveries.

The Dijkstra algorithm can determine the best route with minimal weight. Below listed the pseudocode of implementing Dijkstra:

```
1. Create an empty set called "visited" to keep track of the visited nodes.

2. Create a list called "weights" to store the weights from the starting point to each destination. Initialize all weights to infinity except for the starting point, which is set to 0.

3. Create a list called "destinations" to store the destinations to be visited in determined delivery prioritization.

4. While there are unvisited destinations:
     4.1. Choose the next destination from the "destinations" list, which is not already visited. Let's call this destination "current".
     4.2  Add "current" to the "visited" set.
     4.3  For each neighbor of "current" that is not in the "visited" set:
           4.3.1 Calculate the tentative weight from the starting point to the neighbor through "current". This weight is the sum of the weight from the edges from starting point to "current" and the neighbor.
           4.3.2 If the tentative weight is less than the current weight stored in the "weights" list for the neighbor, update the weights to the tentative weight.
        
5.	Return the "weights" list, which now contains the best route from the starting point to each destination, following the determined delivery order.
```

The above figure displays an example of the representation of the scenario in the form of a weighted graph. Since Dijkstra algorithm always prefer path with lower weight, there is a need to identify weight of all edges using the following algorithm:

1. The edge connects starting point and food order destination. The edge is labelled with weight value of the food order.
2. The edge connects different destinations. The edge is labelled with the distance as its weight.
3. No edge (path) connects starting point and food order destination. However, the weight formula requires distance value. Thus, take the shortest distance of unconnected path between them to be used in weigh value calculation.

After assigning weights to all edges in the graph, the next step is to determine the best route using the Dijkstra algorithm. This algorithm will calculate the shortest path from the starting point to each destination in the determined delivery order. When traveling from one destination to the next, the driver should always choose the shortest path possible. This means selecting the edge with the lowest weight, which represents the shortest distance between two destinations. The detailed scenario background of this graph and algorithm steps will be discussed in the following section.
