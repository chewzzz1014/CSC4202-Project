# 5.2 Delivery Prioritization for Food Orders

At any time, if the driver only receives one food order from the restaurant, then he/she can proceed to complete the order. However, if the driver receives multiple food orders at the same time, the weight value of the food order plays an important role in determining the best delivery route. The delivery should start with the order destination with lowest weight value. The weight value is calculated using the formula

Each food item will be assigned a priority value based on its respective category. The priority value ranges between 0 and 1. The priority value is determined by the remaining shelf life of the food item, where a shorter shelf life corresponds to a higher priority value. A higher priority value indicates that the food item should be prioritized during the delivery process.

The distance factor is given primary consideration in the weight calculation as it covers other secondary costs such as fuel cost and overall efficiency. However, there are scenarios where food quality becomes more significant. This occurs when multiple food orders have similar traveling distances and different combinations of food items. In such cases, the food order with a higher priority value, indicating shorter remaining shelf life, will be prioritized and delivered first. By balancing the weight calculation between distance and priority value, the algorithm ensures optimal delivery decisions that account for both efficiency and customer satisfaction.

The following are the food categories along with their associated priority values:

<table><thead><tr><th width="371">Food Category</th><th>Priority Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cooked Food</td><td>0.3</td></tr><tr><td>Cold / Hot Drinks</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Dessert</td><td>0.8</td></tr></tbody></table>

If the driver receives multiple food orders containing the exact same combination of food items, the priority value for all food items in all food orders is assumed to be 0. Therefore, the weight value solely depends on the distance from the destinations since no food item takes priority over another. Conversely, if the combination of food items differs for each food order, every food item in every order will be assigned a priority value. The maximum priority value among the food items in an order is then selected as the food order's priority value for calculating their respective weight values. The delivery process starts with the food order with the lowest weight value and follows by other food orders in ascending weight value. Below summarized the process for determining the delivery prioritization:

1. If the driver receives a single food order, proceed with delivering that order.
2. If the driver receives multiple food orders with identical combinations of food items, assume all food items have a priority value of 0, and proceed to step 5.
3. If each order consists of a different combination of food items, proceed to step 4.
4. For every order, assign a priority value to each food item. Select the maximum priority value among food items as the food order's priority value.
5. Calculate the weight value for each food order using the provided formula.
6. Start delivering the food order with the lowest weight value, followed by other food orders in ascending weight value.
