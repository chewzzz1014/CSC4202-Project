# 5.4 Example

David, a food delivery driver, has received 3 orders from the same restaurant at the same time. Here are the details for these orders:

Using the current implementation of the delivery route planning algorithm, the order with the closest distance will be delivered first. In this example, order 2 will be delivered first, followed by order 1 and order 3. However, by the time the customer of order 1 receives his food, the ice cream will be melted. The same goes for customer order 3 who will receive her warm Latte. This is why the optimized delivery route algorithm is required for ensuring user satisfaction.

Since David receives multiple orders with different combinations of food items at the same time, the priority value for each food item must be determined for calculating the weight value of orders. Priority value is assigned to food items based on their respective categories. The table below categorises food items into 3 main categories.

To determine the priority value for an order, consider the maximum priority value among its food items. This ensures that the order with the most "urgent" food items will always be prioritized. In the given example, Order 1 will be assigned a priority value of 0.8, Order 2 will have a priority value of 0.3, and Order 3 will have a priority value of 0.5. Subsequently, the weight value for each order can be calculated using the defined weight formula, taking into account both the distance and priority value factors.

Based on the weight values obtained, the delivery prioritization will be as follows: Order 1 will be delivered first, followed by Order 2, and finally Order 3. This sequence is determined by considering both the distance and priority value factors.

In the case of Order 3, it is delivered last due to the longer travelling distance compared to the other orders. However, for Order 1 and Order 2, the priority value outweighs the distance factor since the difference in priority values is significant. Order 1 consists of several desserts with a short remaining shelf life that indicates their urgency. Therefore, they need to be delivered to the customer promptly, prioritizing food quality over distance.

After determining the delivery prioritization, the Dijkstra algorithm is used to find the best delivery route.

Destination = {restaurant, order 1, order 2, order 3}

<table><thead><tr><th width="243">Visited</th><th width="106">Current</th><th width="119">W[Order 1]</th><th width="118">W[Order 2]</th><th>W[Order 3]</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Restaurant</td><td>-</td><td>Infinity</td><td>Infinity</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Restaurant, Order 1</td><td>Order 1</td><td>12</td><td>9</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Restaurant, Order 1, Order 2</td><td>Order 2</td><td>12</td><td>9</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Restaurant, Order 1, Order 2, Order 3</td><td>Order 3</td><td>12</td><td>9</td><td>7</td></tr></tbody></table>

The table above lists the steps of determining the shortest possible route to each destination while delivering the food order following the determined prioritization order. Therefore, David will need to travel in such a way

1. \[Restaurant -> destination order 3 -> destination order 1]: for delivering order 1
2. \[destination order 1 -> destination order 2]: for delivering order 2
3. \[destination order 2 -> destination order 1 -> destination order 3]: for delivering order 3

The total weight of the overall travel is the sum of the weights of each individual travel. In this case, the weight of the first travel is 12, the weight of the second travel is 4, and the weight of the third travel is 9. Therefore, the total weight of the overall travel is 25.
